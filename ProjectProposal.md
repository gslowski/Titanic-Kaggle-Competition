# Project proposal for Titanic Kaggle Competition
Author: Gregory Slowski

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt

I would like to learn the basics of Kaggle competitions, gain more exposure to fresh ML projects, 
and get ideas for future Kaggle competitions.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt

I am going to start with the Kaggle Titanic classification problem as this is a recommended starting point with Kaggle.
I will complete the classification problem using a similar style to the lab notebooks we have done throughout the semester.
I will look at some future competitions I would like to give a try, when I have free time on my hands.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts

Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
Scikit-learn classifiers: LogisticRegression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, SVC
GridSearchCV to optimize the noted models. StandardScaler to acquire similar weighting for each feature.
The data alreay appears to be split into train and test, but if not train_test_split will be utilized.
