Here is where you include:
  - Background on your code files
  - How to run your code, guide to install any additional packages
  - Results, interpretation and reflection

Background on code files:
  Similar to all lab exercises, all work was completed within a Jupyter Lab notebook. Under the main folder see slowski_greg_titanic.ipynb.
  Data from the Titanic Kaggle competition is located in the "Data" folder which includes a training set, a test set, and a sample submission csv.
  
How to run the code, guide to install any additional packages:
  Packages used are standard data science packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.
  The code was run using Jupyter Labs specifically but can be run from any system that can run Jupyter notebooks.
  
Results, interpretation and reflection:
  Please see sections 2, 8, and 9 of the notebook for some interpretation, conclusions and reflections, respectively.
